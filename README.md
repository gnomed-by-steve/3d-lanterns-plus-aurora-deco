# Funny 3D lanterns when you hold them
A small resource pack for the unreleased Aurora's Decorations mod for Quilt.

Should work with any version and any combo of resource pack that doesn't affect the lantern models, as long as no major restructure of the assets folder happens.

Requires https://github.com/LambdAurora/AurorasDecorations because duh

If you want this on vanilla, use https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extended-lantern. I stole the scripts from it to make this lol
